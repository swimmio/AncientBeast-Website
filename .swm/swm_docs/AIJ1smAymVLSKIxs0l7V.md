## How to contribute to the project website

The website is pretty much wrapped around the game itself, meaning it reuses a lot of its assets. To keep things simple, the stable and development versions of the game are also included in this repository, but they'll each require a Node.js server.<br>
Website itself is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and MySQL. It needs to run on a server, a local one will do just fine.

### Installing Dependencies

You'll have to install an Apache HTTP Server, like [AMPPS](http://www.ampps.com/downloads) or operating system specific ones, like [WAMP](http://wampserver.com), [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info) or [LAMP](https://turnkeylinux.org/lampstack).

### Recommended Tool

If you're not very keen on using git from the CLI, I recomment using [Git Cola](https://git-cola.github.io) for cloning the project and creating patches.
